Originally from the United Kingdom, I now live and work as a baptist pastor in the beautiful city of Vienna, Austria. Iâ€™m currently working with the German and Farsi speaking projekt:gemeinde (project:church) Baptist church as part of an international pastoral team, coordinate the [ProjectVienna bible school](https://projectvienna.at) and gap year programme, and head up the Children and Youth work of the [Austrian Baptist Aid](http://austrianbaptistaid.com).
