British Baptist ministers (and all-round good eggs) Beth and David run a wonderful little podcast called 'Something to Declare', where they talk to different people from the UK baptist union and ask them about their experiences of baptist identity and practice. I was honoured to be asked to appear for an episode to talk about baptist life beyond the borders of the UK.
