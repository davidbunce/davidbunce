Corona-times have advantages. One of them is being able to preach in contexts that are geographically far away from my house - without having to leave the comfort of my study. I was honoured to be asked by Regents Park College chaplain Rev Beth Allison-Glenny to preach of the opening sermon on their chapel series on Shameless Audacity.
