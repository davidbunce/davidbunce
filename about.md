title: About
---

Born and raised in the United Kingdom, I have lived in Austria since 2014, where I lived and worked for six years as a baptist pastor in Vienna. Since spring of 2021 I have been pastoring a [Baptist Church](http://www.baptisten-badischl.net/) in the spa town of Bad Ischl (the Salzkammergut, Austria's lake district).

Nationally, I am also the leader of the [Children's and Youth Work](https://kjw-baptisten.at) (KJW) of [Austrian Baptist Aid](http://austrianbaptistaid.com). The KJW works with local churches to champion sustainable children's and youth work, and also facilitates more specialised projects in the areas of resiliance, healthy relationships and emotional health. My responsibilities are primarily in the areas of strategy, teenagers and young adults. I also work on the Austrian Baptist Union home mission board. 

Prior to living in Austria, I lived for five years in St Andrews, Scotland, where I did my degree in German and Theological Studies (MA Hons). I am married to Mairi and we have two children together.

### Pastor, projekt:gemeinde Baptist Church (Vienna, 2015-2020)
I was one of a team of pastors of the German and Farsi speaking [projekt:gemeinde](https://projektgemeinde.wien) (project:church). In this role I had responsibility for preaching and pastoral care of the German speaking congregation, as well as frequently leading worship. 

In addition, I co-ordinated the [ProjectVienna](https://projectvienna.at) bible school and gap year programme and had a lot of pastoral responsibility for short and medium term missionary volunteers and interns.

## Academic
I am also studying for my [MRes in Biblical Interpretation](/about/) at the University of Wales Trinity St David. My research project focuses on Karl Barth's theological exegesis during the 1920s. [More about my academic work](/academic)

## Web Development 
For a long time I also worked as a web developer. I have helped a number of great organisations with their website, including:

- A database of women spakers for [Project328](http://speaker328.info/)
- the web shop for the Christian publisher [Grove Books](https://grovebooks.co.uk)
- the online web presence for [Girls' Brigade International](http://gbworldwide.org/)

This has taken a back seat in the last few years as I have moved into other ministry related roles - not least for my own health and so I can spend time with my family. 

However, I still take on the occassional web project for the right client: I'm particularly interested in helping out clients who work for innovative Christian ministries, justice work and gender equality.
