I have lived in Austria since 2014, where I live and work as a baptist pastor in the beautiful city of Vienna, Austria. Prior to that, I lived for five years in St Andrews, Scotland.

My time is spent in three main ways: Iâ€™m part of the pastoral team the German and Farsi speaking [projekt:gemeinde](https://projektgemeinde.wien) (project:church); I co-ordinate the [ProjectVienna](https://projectvienna.at) bible school and gap year programme; and head up the Children and Youth Work (KJW) of [Austrian Baptist Aid](http://austrianbaptistaid.com). 

I am also studying for my [MRes in Biblical Interpretation](/about/) at the University of Wales Trinity St David. 

## Web Development 
For a long time I also worked as a web developer. I have helped a number of great organisations with their website, including:

- A database of women spakers for [Project328](http://speaker328.info/)
- the web shop for the Christian publisher [Grove Books](https://grovebooks.co.uk)
- the online web presence for [Girls' Brigade International](http://gbworldwide.org/)

This has taken a back seat in the last few years as I have moved into other ministry related roles - not least for my own health and so I can spend time with my family. 

However, I still take on the occassional web project for the right client: I'm particularly interested in helping out clients who work for innovative Christian ministries, justice work and gender equality.
