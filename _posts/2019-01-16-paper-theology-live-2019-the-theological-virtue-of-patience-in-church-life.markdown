<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n 10th January 2019, I was pleased to be able to give a paper at the Theology Live conference in Bloomsbury Baptist Church 2019. My paper focused on the theological virtue of patience in church life and drew on experiences from the Austrian Baptist Union.</p>

The conference is a showcase for Baptists involved in postgraduate level research to share what they are learning, and was an excellent day with some fascinating papers. You can listen to the full line-up of papers [on the Bloomsbury website](http://www.bloomsbury.org.uk/single-post/2019/01/16/Theology-Live-2019) 

Particular highlights from me are Dan Pratt’s paper on contextual trauma theologies and Beth Allison-Glenny’s fun and stimulating paper looking at Judith Butler and baptism.
